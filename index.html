            <h1>CHAPTER ONE <br><br>
                The Pain
            </h1><br>
            <p class="par">On a serene Monday morning, the sun gently peeked over the horizon, casting a soft, 
                golden glow across the dew-kissed grass. The chirping of birds filled the air, creating a 
                symphony of nature's awakening. The scent of fresh blooms wafted through the air, 
                carried by a gentle breeze that whispered promises of a beautiful day. The world 
                seemed to pause in that magical moment, Chronicles stood in the doorway, his gaze 
                fixed on his mother, a beacon of warmth and love, as she gracefully moved around the 
                kitchen. The clinking of utensils and the sizzle of ingredients filled the air, creating a 
                comforting melody that resonated deep within him. Her hands moved with practiced 
                ease, a symphony of culinary mastery that Chronicles had always admired. In the midst 
                of her busy life as a doctor, his mother found solace and joy in her culinary pursuits, 
                especially on her precious day off. The aroma of her cooking filled the air, a symphony 
                of flavors waiting to delight her son's taste buds. Despite the demands of her 
                profession, her love for her son manifested in the carefully prepared dishes, each one a 
                labor of love and atestament to the bond they shared. In those moments, the doctor 
                transformed into a chef, infusing her creations with not just ingredients but with the
                warmth and care that only a mother's touch could provide. As he watched her, a sense 
                of gratitude and admiration swelled in his heart, knowing that her love was not just in 
                the meals she prepared but in every gesture, every glance, and every shared moment. In 
                that simple yet profound moment, Chronicles felt the depth of his love for his mother, a 
                bond that transcended words and time. <br><br>
                Meanwhile, it wasn't just a regular kind of Monday. It was a kind held a weighty promise 
                for Chronicles, a day where his aspirations and efforts converged in a momentous 
                opportunity. Chronicles' heart raced with anticipation as he meticulously readied himself 
                for the pivotal job interview at his dream company. The air crackled with a mix of 
                anxiety and hope, painting the day in vibrant hues of significance. The kitchen, usually a 
                place of comfort, now buzzed with a different energy, mirroring Chronicles' feelings as 
                he geared up for this crucial step in his journey. Amidst the job interview nerves, the 
                mother, with a look of unwavering pride and love, enveloped her son in a reassuring 
                embrace. Her words, filled with a blend of encouragement and maternal wisdom, carried 
                the weight of a lifetime of missed moments yet brimmed with hope for the future. As 
                she spoke, her voice held a gentle strength, a testament to the resilience that had 
                carried her through years of raising her son alone. Despite the absence of the father, her 
                unwavering support and belief in her son's potential shone through, painting a picture of 
                maternal love that transcended the boundaries of time and circumstance. In the midst 
                of the hustle and bustle, Chronicles set out for the interview, buoyed by his mother's 
                unwavering support, a beacon of hope and determination guiding his steps. With a heart 
                filled with anticipation and courage, he embarked on his journey, choosing a taxi as his 
                chariot to carry him to the doorstep of his dreams. The city whizzed by outside the taxi 
                window, a blur of possibilities and opportunities awaiting Chronicles as he hurtled 
                towards his destination, his resolve unwavering and his spirit alight with ambition. <br><br>
                Hours later, he arrives back home, his mind still buzzing with the possibilities of the job. In 
                the wake of his return home, Chronicles was met with a chilling scene that sent shivers 
                down his spine. The door gaping wide open, a harbinger of dread, greeted him as he 
                arrived. With trembling hands and a hearth eavy with foreboding, he stepped inside, only 
                to be confronted by a tragedy beyond comprehension. His beloved mother, the pillar of 
                his existence, lay motionless on the floor, a victim of a senseless and cruel fate. The 
                weight of shock and grief bore down on him, unleashing a torrent of anguish as he cried 
                out for help, the echoes of his pain reverberating through the ruins of his 
                shattered world. And then, everything changes in an instant. His mother, once vibrant 
                and full of life, now lay lifeless on the floor, a pool of blood staining the ground around 
                her. The shock and grief engulfed him like a tidal wave, leaving him gasping for breath in 
                the face of this unfathomable tragedy. A piercing scream tore through the silence, a raw 
                expression of the anguish and disbelief that gripped his soul at that moment of heart-wrenching realization. <br><br>
                The sound of Chronicles's scream reverberated through the neighborhood, a haunting 
                call that stirred the concern of nearby neighbors. Responding swiftly to the distress, 
                they gathered around him, offering solace and solidarity in the face of the 
                incomprehensible tragedy that had unfolded. Their faces mirrored his own disbelief and 
                sorrow, a shared expression of the their shock and empathy. Chronicles found himself adrift in a sea of emotions, 
                overwhelmed by the tumultuous whirlwind of feelings that threatened to consume him. 
                The intensity of Chronicles's grief was palpable as he clung tightly to his mother's 
                lifeless form, tears flowing freely from his eyes. The arrival of the ambulance signaled a 
                glimmer of hope in the midst of despair, as the paramedics worked tirelessly to gently 
                pry his grip from his mother's body, a heart-wrenching moment of separation that tore 
                at his very soul. Despite their efforts, Chronicles's resistance was fierce, a testament to 
                the depth of his love and loss, his cries echoing through the crowd as his mother was 
                slowly taken away, leaving him to grapple with the harsh reality of her absence. <br><br>
                The neighbors, one by one, offered Chronicles words of encouragement as they 
                departed, their gestures of support a bitter sweet reminder of their care and compassion 
                during his darkest hour. Each well-intentioned phrase served as a life line in the sea of 
                grief, a beacon of hope amid the storm of emotions that threatened to overwhelm him. 
                As the last of them left, Chronicles was left to navigate the quiet emptiness of his home, 
                carrying with him the echoes of their kind words like fragile whispers in the wind. The 
                harsh reality weighed heavily on Chronicles as he found himself alone in the silent 
                confines of the house, the echoes of loss reverberating through the empty rooms like a 
                haunting melody. The absence of his mother's presence, once a source of comfort and 
                warmth, now left him adrift in a sea of sorrow and uncertainty. The familiar sights and 
                sounds of home now felt foreign and desolate, a stark reminder of the gaping void that 
                her absence had carved in his heart. In the solitude of his grief, Chronicles grappled with 
                the cruel reality of a world forever altered by the irrevocable loss of his dear mother, a 
                profound emptiness that seemed to engulf everything in its wake.The pain he felt was 
                like a relentless storm raging within him, tearing at the very fabric of his being. It was a 
                raw, visceral ache that gnawed at his soul, a constant companion in his moments of 
                solitude and despair. Every breath seemed to carry the weight of his loss, every 
                heartbeat a painful reminder of the void left by his mother's absence. the air thickens 
                with sorrow suffocating him, each breath feels like a burden. The thought of not breathing, 
                of escaping the relentless ache within, whispers seductively like a siren's call, offering 
                respite from the unending agony that envelope him. In the depths of 
                his anguish, Chronicles found himself engulfed by a darkness so profound that even the 
                faintest glimmer of hope struggled to penetrate its suffocating grip. <br><br>
                The movement Chronicles made from one part of the house to the other was a hesitant 
                dance, each step echoing through the empty corridors like a whisper in the stillness of 
                the night. As he traversed the familiar spaces, the memories of happier times flickered 
                like distant stars in the vast expanse of his mind, casting fleeting shadows that danced 
                at the edges of his vision. The sleepless night he endured was a relentless journey 
                through the shadows of his mind, haunted by memories that danced like specters in the 
                darkness. Each passing hour stretched endlessly, the silence broken only by the echoes 
                of his own restless thoughts. The weight of his grief pressed down upon him like a 
                suffocating blanket, stealing away any chance of respite as he lay tangled in the threads 
                of his sorrow. In the lonely expanse of the night, he found himself adrift in a sea 
                of emotions, navigating the turbulent waters of his heartache with nothing but the dim 
                light of dawn on the horizon. <br><br>
                The days stretched endlessly for Chronicles, devoid of purpose or direction, each 
                moment a hollow echo of the vibrant life he once knew. In the quiet solitude of his home, 
                the absence of his mother's presence loomed large, casting a shadow over his every 
                thought and action. The once-familiarr outines now felt like empty rituals, devoid of 
                meaning in a world that seemed to have lost its color and warmth. He wandered 
                through the hours like a ghost, in a sea of loneliness with no beacon to guide him back 
                to shore. The funeral day arrived, and Chronicles stood in somber silence as his mother 
                was laid to rest at the cemetery. Dressed in black, he watched with a heavy heart as her 
                lifeless form was gently lowered into the earth, the finality of the moment weighing 
                down on him like a crushing weight. Tear swelled up behind his darkshades, silent 
                witnesses to the depth of his grief as he bid farewell to the one who had been his rock 
                and anchor in a world now without her.
